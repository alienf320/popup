# Angular Pop-up Component

This project implements a reusable pop-up component in Angular 18 as part of a technical test. The pop-up supports open/close functionality, is styled with SCSS, and follows Angular best practices.

## Design Decisions

To meet the requirements of the technical test, two separate components (PopupComponent for "Request Document" and RejectPopupComponent for "Reject Document") were implemented. Ideally, a single reusable pop-up component with dynamic content (configured via a service) would be preferred to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. However, due to the 2-hour time constraint of the test, separate components were created to prioritize delivering functional and accurate implementations of both modals as specified in the Figma design. A single reusable component would require additional time to design a flexible configuration system and ensure robust handling of varying form fields and logic.
